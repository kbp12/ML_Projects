"""

#Objective - To predict weight of a person when we know the height of the person(male)
#we are using the data from the public website - https://www.kaggle.com/mustafaali96/weight-height

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#we first imported the data and created the dataframe of the data which we will use for our task

#we are importing the pandas library for creating the dataframe  
import pandas as pd

#Here we have created a dataframe from the data
#Give the location where the dataset is stored in next line
dataset = pd.read_excel("weight-height.xlsx")
print(type(dataset))
print(dataset)

#Now create the two arrays of weight and height and store them in two variables
x = dataset.iloc[ : , :-1].values
y = dataset.iloc[ : , [1]].values

#x is height and y is weight 
print(type(x))
print(type(y))

#here we are importint the function which splits the data into two parts named as train and test
#we are using the sklearn library and model_selection module for importing the data
#we are giving random_state value to 1, for having better accuracy of ur model
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
xtrain, xtest, ytrain, ytest = train_test_split(x, y, test_size = 1/5, random_state=1)

#here we are importing the LinearRegression function from sklearn library and linear_model module
#then we are using it for traning the data
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
function = LinearRegression()

function.fit(xtrain , ytrain)

#function.coef_ gives the values of coefficient and fucnction.intercept_ gives intercept value
print(function.coef_)
slope = function.coef_
print(slope)

print(function.intercept_)
intercept = function.intercept_
print(intercept)

#fuunction.predict() predicts the respective value of y for given values of x which are present in xtest
ypred = function.predict(xtest)
print(ypred)
print(ytest)

#we are using r2_score function for calculationg the accuarcy of linear model
from sklearn.metrics import r2_score
r2_score( ytest, ypred)

#here, we are ploting the graph x-y for height-weight predicted
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
print = plt.plot(xtest, ytest)
print1 = plt.plot(xtest, ypred)

#now we can write the solution as y = mx + c
answer = slope*xtest + intercept
